# [SudokuNg](https://sudoku-6fbd2.web.app/)

Angular app for playing Sudoku puzzles.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Vitest](https://vitest.dev).

### Component Testing

Vitest and [Angular Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/angular-testing-library/examples) are used for component testing. You can run the tests with `ng test` or `npm run test`. The tests are located in the `src/app` directory and follow the naming convention `*.spec.ts`.
